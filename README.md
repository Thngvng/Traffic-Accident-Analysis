Limitations
This dataset includes all traffic collisions events where a person was either Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) from 2006 – 2023. The location of crime occurrences have been deliberately offset to the nearest road intersection node to protect the privacy of parties involved in the occurrence. Due to the offset of occurrence location, the numbers by Division and Neighbourhood may not reflect the exact count of occurrences reported within these geographies. Therefore, the Toronto Police Service does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness of the data and it should not be compared to any other source of crime data.
